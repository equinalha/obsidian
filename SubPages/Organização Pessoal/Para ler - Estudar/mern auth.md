[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html), [React](https://react.dev/learn), and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/docs) are the components of the MERN stack, one of the most widely used web development stacks out there today.

The MERN stack enables programmers to create dependable web applications with strong capabilities. Yet, security should be a key concern with any web application.

User authentication and permissions are some of the most important security features of any web service. In order to protect sensitive information and stop unauthorized access to important functions, these make sure that only authorized users can access certain areas of the application.

By the end of this article, you will have a firm grasp on how to integrate [JWT ](https://jwt.io/introduction) (Json Web Token)-based user authentication and authorization into your MERN stack web application.

## What is User Authentication & Authorization?

In application security, authentication and authorization are two crucial ideas that work together to guarantee access to the resources of an application.

Many people frequently confuse these words – but after reading this guide, will we? NOT AGAIN!

### Authentication

Verifying a user's or an entity's identity is the process called **Authentication**. It entails validating the user's credentials, such as a username and password, to ensure that the user is who they claim to be.

### Authorization

The process of authorizing or refusing access to particular resources or functions within an application is known as **Authorization**. Once a user has been verified as authentic, the program checks their level of authorization to decide which areas of the application they can access.

**Authentication** is comparable to when a college applicant is admitted to a program based on the results of a written exam. The student is permitted on school grounds, but is not permitted in a department or class that is not their own (that was not given to them during admission). This action is known as **Authorization**.

## What is the MERN Stack?

Let's talk about the various elements of the MERN stack before we start creating the authentication mechanism.

1. **MongoDB** is a NoSQL database that uses dynamic schemas and documents that resemble JSON to store data. MongoDB is a popular option for creating scalable web applications because it is effective at managing big amounts of data.
2. **Express.js** is a Node.js web application framework that offers a selection of functionality for creating online applications. Express.js is a well-liked option for developing online applications since it is compact, quick, and simple to use.
3. **React.js** is a JavaScript library used to create user interfaces. By disassembling complicated user interfaces into smaller, reusable components, React.js offers a declarative method for doing so.
4. **Node.js** is based on the V8 JavaScript engine in Chrome, and is a JavaScript runtime. The ability to run JavaScript on the server-side makes Node.js the perfect platform for creating web applications.

## Why Use the MERN Stack?

The MERN stack is a great option for developing web applications since it includes all of the technologies needed to create a cutting-edge, scalable online application.

Following a discussion of the various elements of the MERN stack, we will use code snippets to develop a whole user authentication system from scratch.

## How to Set Up the Project Environment

To get started with building the authentication system, we first need to set up the project. We will create a new React application using `create-react-app` and install the required dependencies. We will also set up `MongoDB` and configure our `Node.js` server.

NB: In this article, we will be making use of [Visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) editor, which I highly recommend.

Before we dive into this, you're going to create a folder which will contain other sub folders as you move on in this article.

After creating your folder, it should look like the image below:

![[JrxZbI3.png]]

The folder you just created will contain two sub folders called the `client` and `server`. Run the commands below in your terminal to create the sub folders:

```plain text
mkdir client

```

This will create the `client` sub folder.

```plain text
mkdir server

```

This will create the `server` sub folder. Your application folder should look like this:

![[jwPj09J.png]]

### How to Create a New React Application

You can create a new React application using `create-react-app`. Open your terminal and run the below command to create a new React application.

But first, you will need to go into the `client` folder using `cd client`, then run the following command:

```plain text
npx create-react-app

```

After the command above has successfully created the app, type `npm start` in your terminal. Make sure you're in your `client` directory. Your output should look like the image below:

![[Y8N9gbL.png]]

Before we move to the server directory, you will need to remove some boilerplate in your React application. Your `client` should look like the image below;

![[27WytE6.png]]

Once you're done with the above, restart your React application by running `npm start` in your terminal. Your application should be looking like this:

![[ws2F4wH.png]]

Now, you've successfully setup your client side of the application 😊 yeah!

### Node.js and Express.js Installation and Configuration

To setup your backend application, run `mkdir server` in your terminal to get into the `server` sub folder. After getting into the `server` sub folder, run the following command to initialize the backend application:

```plain text
npm init --yes

```

The `npm init --yes` command in Node.js creates a new `package.json` file for a project with default settings, without asking the user any questions.

The `--yes` or `-y` flag tells npm to use default values for all prompts that would normally appear during the initialization process.

The server folder should now contain a `package.json` file just like so:

```plain text
{
  "name": "server",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}


```

To install Express.js and other dependencies, run the following commands in your terminal:

```plain text
 npm install express cors bcrypt cookie-parser nodemon jsonwebtoken mongoose dotenv


```

The above commands install the following dependencies:

- `Express.js`, which is our Node.js web application framework.
- `bcrypt`, which helps us hash the user's password.
- `cookie-parser` is the the cookie-parser middleware that handles cookie-based sessions. It extracts information from cookies that may be required for authentication or other purposes.
- `nodemon` is a tool used to automatically restart a Node.js application whenever changes are made to the code.
- `CORS` is a middleware used to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for an Express.js application.
- `jsonwebtoken` helps us create and verify JSON Web Tokens.
- `dotenv` allows you to store configuration data in a `.env` file, which is typically not committed to version control, to separate sensitive information from your codebase. This file contains key-value pairs that represent the environment variables.

After installing the required dependencies, create a new file called `index.js `in the root directory of your `server` sub folder of your application. The `index.js` file will contain our Node.js server.

In the `index.js` file of your `server`, add the following code:

```plain text
const express = require("express");

const app = express();
const PORT = 4000;

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is listening on port ${PORT}`);
});

```

Before you start the server, update your `package.json` file in the server by adding the code below:

```plain text
  "scripts":{
  start: "nodemon index.js",
  test: 'echo "Error: no test specified" && exit 1',
};


```

This will make sure your application restarts on any update. Now, you can start your `server` by running `npm start` in your terminal.

If all these are successfully executed, your terminal should look like this:

![[EsjRkqi.png]]

### How to Set Up MongoDB

You're almost done with setting up your application. If you do not have `mongodb` installed your computer, follow these [steps](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

Now, I assume you have successfully installed `mongodb` on your computer. To link your database to your backend, follow the procedures below.

STEP 1: Go into your MongoDB cloud clusters, which should look like the image below:

![[MZbppS2.png]]

STEP 2: Click on the Database Access, which is on the left of the sidebar. Click on `ADD NEW DATABASE USER` which will pop up a modal, like the image below:

![[Hyiky7V.png]]

STEP 3: Fill out the `Password Authentication` with your desired username and password for the database of this particular project.

STEP 4: Before saving this, click the `Built-in Role` dropdown, and select `Read and write to any database`. Now, go ahead to click `Add user`.

STEP 5: Click on `Database`, and on the left side of the sidebar, click the `connect` button, which is beside `View Monitoring`. A modal popup will be displayed, then click `connect your application` and copy the code snippet you find there.

![[Hqmbxro.png]]

You will replace `<username>` and `<password>` with the username and password you created in `STEP 3` in your `index.js` file in the server folder.

Before going into your `index.js` file, you will create a `.env` file in your `server` directory, which will contain your `MONGODB_URL`, `PORT`, `database_name`, and `database_password` like the code below:

```plain text
MONGO_URL =
  "mongodb+srv://database_name:database_password@cluster0.fbx6x.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority";
PORT = 4000;

```

Once you're done with this, go into your `index.js` in your `server` directory, and update it with the code below:

```plain text
const express = require("express");
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const cors = require("cors");
const app = express();
require("dotenv").config();
const { MONGO_URL, PORT } = process.env;

mongoose
  .connect(MONGO_URL, {
    useNewUrlParser: true,
    useUnifiedTopology: true,
  })
  .then(() => console.log("MongoDB is  connected successfully"))
  .catch((err) => console.error(err));

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is listening on port ${PORT}`);
});

app.use(
  cors({
    origin: ["http://localhost:4000"],
    methods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"],
    credentials: true,
  })
);

app.use(express.json());

```

In the code above, we are configuring our application to be able to have access to the `.env` file. You can get the information in your `.env` file by doing `process.env`.

So you're destructing the values from the `.env` file by doing `process.env` so you don't repeat yourself (DRY) which is a good engineering practice.

- CORS (Cross origin resource sharing): You can allow requests from other domains to access the resources on your server by using the `cors()` express middleware function. The CORS headers that your server should include in the response can be specified using the function's optional configuration object parameter, which is taken as a parameter by the function which is the `origin`, `methods` and `credentials`.
- express.json(): The `express.json()` will add a `body` property to the `request` or `req` object. This includes the request body's parsed JSON data. `req.body` in your route handler function will allow you to access this data.
- useNewUrlParser: This property specifies that Mongoose should use the new URL parser to parse MongoDB connection strings. This is set to true by default.
- useUnifiedTopology: This property specifies that Mongoose should use the new Server Discovery and Monitoring engine. This is set to false by default.

After following the steps above, you will restart your application by doing `npm start` in your `server` directory. Your terminal should look like the image below;

![[Ly8zIk5.png]]

## How to Implement the Backend

Create the following folders in the `server` directory of your application after first ensuring that you are in that directory. `Controllers`, `Middlewares`, `Routes`, `Models`, and `util` are the names of these folders.

### How to Handle the SIGNUP Route

Create a file called `UserModel.js` in the `Models` directory and put the following code into it to get started:

```plain text
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const bcrypt = require("bcryptjs");

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  email: {
    type: String,
    required: [true, "Your email address is required"],
    unique: true,
  },
  username: {
    type: String,
    required: [true, "Your username is required"],
  },
  password: {
    type: String,
    required: [true, "Your password is required"],
  },
  createdAt: {
    type: Date,
    default: new Date(),
  },
});

userSchema.pre("save", async function () {
  this.password = await bcrypt.hash(this.password, 12);
});

module.exports = mongoose.model("User", userSchema);

```

The user schema and user password will be created in the above code using `mongoose` and `bcryptjs`, respectively, for security purposes.

The `password` is hashed for security reasons prior to saving the user.

Next, you will setup a function to handle the generation of a atoken, which will be called `SecretToken.js` in the `util` folder. Copy and paste the code below into the newly created file (`SecretToken.js`):

```plain text
require("dotenv").config();
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");

module.exports.createSecretToken = (id) => {
  return jwt.sign({ id }, process.env.TOKEN_KEY, {
    expiresIn: 3 * 24 * 60 * 60,
  });
};

```

Once that's done, create a file called `AuthController.js` in the `Controllers` directory and paste in the following code:

```plain text
const User = require("../Models/UserModel");
const { createSecretToken } = require("../util/SecretToken");
const bcrypt = require("bcryptjs");

module.exports.Signup = async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const { email, password, username, createdAt } = req.body;
    const existingUser = await User.findOne({ email });
    if (existingUser) {
      return res.json({ message: "User already exists" });
    }
    const user = await User.create({ email, password, username, createdAt });
    const token = createSecretToken(user._id);
    res.cookie("token", token, {
      withCredentials: true,
      httpOnly: false,
    });
    res
      .status(201)
      .json({ message: "User signed in successfully", success: true, user });
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
};

```

The user's inputs are obtained from the `req.body` in the code above, and you then check the `email` to make sure no past registrations have been made. We'll use the values obtained from `req.body` to create the new `user` after that has occurred.

You don't need to worry about how the unique `_id` was obtained because MongoDB always assigns a new user with a unique `_id`

The newly formed `user`'s `_id` is then supplied as an parameter to the `createSecretToken()` function, which handles token generation.

The `cookie` will be sent to the client with key of `"token"`, and value of `token`.

Next, create a file called `AuthRoute.js` in the `Routes` directory. Paste the code below into the newly created file:

```plain text
const { Signup } = require("../Controllers/AuthController");
const router = require("express").Router();

router.post("/signup", Signup);

module.exports = router;

```

In the code above, the `/signup` route has a `post` method attached to it, when it's been called, the `Signup` controller will be executed.

Next, update your `index.js` file so it can be aware of the routes. Your `index.js` file should look like the code below:

```plain text
const express = require("express");
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const cors = require("cors");
const app = express();
require("dotenv").config();
const cookieParser = require("cookie-parser");
const authRoute = require("./Routes/AuthRoute");
const { MONGO_URL, PORT } = process.env;

mongoose
  .connect(MONGO_URL, {
    useNewUrlParser: true,
    useUnifiedTopology: true,
  })
  .then(() => console.log("MongoDB is  connected successfully"))
  .catch((err) => console.error(err));

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is listening on port ${PORT}`);
});

app.use(
  cors({
    origin: ["http://localhost:3000"],
    methods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"],
    credentials: true,
  })
);
app.use(cookieParser());

app.use(express.json());

app.use("/", authRoute);

```

The `cookie-parser` manages cookie-based sessions or extracts data from cookies. It's added to the code above along with the `authRoute` that the application will utilize.

Now, let's go ahead to test the `/signup` route with a tool called [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/). Make sure you're in the `server` directory in the terminal, then run `npm start` to start your application.

![[zzN1QyQ.png]]

The image above shows the response gotten when a request is sent.

![[8jrGe0T.png]]

The image above shows the generated cookie from the response.

![[KJ8haPB.png]]

The image above illustrates what happens when you try to use a registered email.

By now, the user will be created in the database like the image below:

![[XQsjWRt.png]]

### How to Handle the LOGIN Route

Open the `AuthController.js` file in the `Controllers` directory, and update it with the code below:

```plain text
module.exports.Login = async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const { email, password } = req.body;
    if(!email || !password ){
      return res.json({message:'All fields are required'})
    }
    const user = await User.findOne({ email });
    if(!user){
      return res.json({message:'Incorrect password or email' })
    }
    const auth = await bcrypt.compare(password,user.password)
    if (!auth) {
      return res.json({message:'Incorrect password or email' })
    }
     const token = createSecretToken(user._id);
     res.cookie("token", token, {
       withCredentials: true,
       httpOnly: false,
     });
     res.status(201).json({ message: "User logged in successfully", success: true });
     next()
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}

```

You are determining in the code above whether the `email` and `password` match any previously stored `user` in the database.

Then add the following code to the file `AuthRoute.js` in the `Routes` directory:

```plain text
const { Signup, Login } = require('../Controllers/AuthController')
const router = require('express').Router()

router.post('/signup', Signup)
router.post('/login', Login)

module.exports = router

```

Now, let's go ahead to test the application:

![[gwRjAGk.png]]

If you try to use an unregistered `email` or `password`, you'll get the message below:

![[fLj20iU.png]]

### How to Handle the HOME Route

Now, you will create a `AuthMiddleware.js` file, in the `Middlewares` directory, and paste in the code below:

```plain text
const User = require("../Models/UserModel");
require("dotenv").config();
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");

module.exports.userVerification = (req, res) => {
  const token = req.cookies.token
  if (!token) {
    return res.json({ status: false })
  }
  jwt.verify(token, process.env.TOKEN_KEY, async (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
     return res.json({ status: false })
    } else {
      const user = await User.findById(data.id)
      if (user) return res.json({ status: true, user: user.username })
      else return res.json({ status: false })
    }
  })
}

```

The code above checks if the user has access to the route by checking if the `token`s match.

Next, update the `AuthRoute.js` file in the `Routes` directory with the code below:

```plain text
router.post('/',userVerification)

```

Now, you can go ahead to test your route. It should look like the image below:

![[xk1J1Zs.png]]

## How to Implement the Frontend

To get started, go into the `client` directory and install the following in your terminal:

```plain text
npm install react-cookie react-router-dom react-toastify axios

```

Now, update the `index.js` file in the `client` directory with the code snippet below:

![[LcoXMWB.png]]

In the code above, wrapping your `App` component with `BrowserRouter` is necessary to enable client-side routing and take advantage of its benefits in your application.

NB: Remove the `React.StrictMode` later when you are testing the application and your data is being fetched twice.

Also, import `react-toastify` so it can be available in your application.

Now, go ahead to create the `pages` directory in your `client` directory, which will contain the `Home.jsx` file, `Login.jsx` file, `Signup.jsx` and `index.js` to export the components. Your folder should look like the image below:

![[G4rQ48P.png]]

Now, fill the `Login.jsx`, `Signup.jsx`, and `Home.jsx`, respectively, with the code below. These snippets below, are functional components which will be modified later in this guide.

NB: This can be automatically generated by typing the shortcut `rafce` + `enter` in the file you want to add the snippet in your visual studio code editor. Make sure this [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets) is installed in your visual studio code for this to work.

`Login.jsx`:

```plain text
import React from "react";

const Login = () => {
  return <h1>Login Page</h1>;
};

export default Login

```

`Signup.jsx`:

```plain text
import React from "react";

const Signup = () => {
  return <h1>Signup Page</h1>;
};

export default Signup

```

`Home.jsx`:

```plain text
import React from "react";

const Home = () => {
  return <h1>Home PAGE</h1>;
};

export default Home

```

After that's done, you will go into the `index.js` file in the `pages` directory to export the newly created components. It should look like the image below:

The method shown above makes importing components easier by requiring only one import line.

Now, update the `App.js` file in the `src` directory with the code below.

```plain text
import { Route, Routes } from "react-router-dom";
import { Login, Signup } from "./pages";
import Home from "./pages/Home";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/login" element={<Login />} />
        <Route path="/signup" element={<Signup />} />
      </Routes>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

```

The routes will be made available in your application using the above code. The example below will help to clarify:

### How to Handle the Signup Logic

In the `Signup.jsx` file in the `pages` directory, paste the following code snippet:

```plain text
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { Link, useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";
import axios from "axios";
import { ToastContainer, toast } from "react-toastify";

const Signup = () => {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState({
    email: "",
    password: "",
    username: "",
  });
  const { email, password, username } = inputValue;
  const handleOnChange = (e) => {
    const { name, value } = e.target;
    setInputValue({
      ...inputValue,
      [name]: value,
    });
  };

  const handleError = (err) =>
    toast.error(err, {
      position: "bottom-left",
    });
  const handleSuccess = (msg) =>
    toast.success(msg, {
      position: "bottom-right",
    });

  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    try {
      const { data } = await axios.post(
        "http://localhost:4000/signup",
        {
          ...inputValue,
        },
        { withCredentials: true }
      );
      const { success, message } = data;
      if (success) {
        handleSuccess(message);
        setTimeout(() => {
          navigate("/");
        }, 1000);
      } else {
        handleError(message);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(error);
    }
    setInputValue({
      ...inputValue,
      email: "",
      password: "",
      username: "",
    });
  };

  return (
    <div className="form_container">
      <h2>Signup Account</h2>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <div>
          <label htmlFor="email">Email</label>
          <input
            type="email"
            name="email"
            value={email}
            placeholder="Enter your email"
            onChange={handleOnChange}
          />

            value={username}
            placeholder="Enter your username"
            onChange={handleOnChange}

### How to Handle the Login Logic

Add the following code snippet to the `Login.jsx` file in the `pages` directory:

```plain text
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { Link, useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";
import axios from "axios";
import { ToastContainer, toast } from "react-toastify";

const Login = () => {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState({
    email: "",
    password: "",
  });
  const { email, password } = inputValue;
  const handleOnChange = (e) => {
    const { name, value } = e.target;
    setInputValue({
      ...inputValue,
      [name]: value,
    });
  };

  const handleError = (err) =>
    toast.error(err, {
      position: "bottom-left",
    });
  const handleSuccess = (msg) =>
    toast.success(msg, {
      position: "bottom-left",
    });

  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    try {
      const { data } = await axios.post(
        "http://localhost:4000/login",
        {
          ...inputValue,
        },
        { withCredentials: true }
      );
      console.log(data);
      const { success, message } = data;
      if (success) {
        handleSuccess(message);
        setTimeout(() => {
          navigate("/");
        }, 1000);
      } else {
        handleError(message);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(error);
    }
    setInputValue({
      ...inputValue,
      email: "",
      password: "",
    });
  };

  return (
    <div className="form_container">
      <h2>Login Account</h2>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <div>
          <label htmlFor="email">Email</label>
          <input
            type="email"
            name="email"
            value={email}
            placeholder="Enter your email"
            onChange={handleOnChange}
          />
        </div>
        <div>
          <label htmlFor="password">Password</label>
          <input
            type="password"
            name="password"
            value={password}
            placeholder="Enter your password"
            onChange={handleOnChange}
          />
        </div>
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        <span>
          Already have an account? <Link to={"/signup"}>Signup</Link>
        </span>
      </form>
      <ToastContainer />
    </div>
  );
};

export default Login;


```

### How to Handle the Home Page Logic

Copy and paste the following code snippet into the `Home.jsx` file located in the `pages` directory:

```plain text
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";
import { useCookies } from "react-cookie";
import axios from "axios";
import { ToastContainer, toast } from "react-toastify";

const Home = () => {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const [cookies, removeCookie] = useCookies([]);
  const [username, setUsername] = useState("");
  useEffect(() => {
    const verifyCookie = async () => {
      if (!cookies.token) {
        navigate("/login");
      }
      const { data } = await axios.post(
        "http://localhost:4000",
        {},
        { withCredentials: true }
      );
      const { status, user } = data;
      setUsername(user);
      return status
        ? toast(`Hello ${user}`, {
            position: "top-right",
          })
        : (removeCookie("token"), navigate("/login"));
    };
    verifyCookie();
  }, [cookies, navigate, removeCookie]);
  const Logout = () => {
    removeCookie("token");
    navigate("/signup");
  };
  return (
    <>
      <div className="home_page">
        <h4>
          {" "}
          Welcome <span>{username}</span>
        </h4>
        <button onClick={Logout}>LOGOUT</button>
      </div>
      <ToastContainer />
    </>
  );
};

export default Home;

```
